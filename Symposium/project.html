      <h3 align=left>Project success belongs to the way you adapt to present it. If you present your project in an effective way that you grab the intention of your client and take him/her to an agreement but if you create blunders and skip important points that you need to discuss while presenting your project.</h3>

	  <h3>Project Presentation is a formal submission of a project to stakeholders for familiarization, discussion and acceptance. It takes several forms: 1) a page of the project plan to describe the project to the reader, and 2) a meeting to announce the project and state about expected benefits and outcomes to be produced upon successful project completion.

 <h3><pre>Regardless of which form is used, a typical project presentation serves the following purposes:
1)Providing a planning and organizational tool to the target audience (stakeholders) before the project begins
2)Outlining a preferred course of action for implementing the project
3)Creating a brief description of the project, including business drivers, strategic goals, tactical objectives, desired deliverables, others.
Often both forms of project presentation are used in reviewing and accepting projects. Presenting a project to stakeholders means explaining the need for project launch and describing key advantages and benefits expected from project delivery. As a rule, project presentation is developed at the very beginning of the project (during the initiation phase) before this project is approved.</pre></h3>
