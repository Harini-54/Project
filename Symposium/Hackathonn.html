      <h2 align=left style="color:DarkSalmon">A hackathon, also known as a codefest, is a social coding event that brings computer programmers and other interested people together to improve upon or build a new software program.
The word hackathon is a portmanteau of the words hacker, which means clever programmer, and marathon, an event marked by endurance.</h2>

   <h3 align=left style="color:LightPink">some of the most asked questions about hackathon:-</h3>
   <h4 align=left style="color:HoneyDew">What is a hackathon? - A hackathon is usually a day long (can be 36 hours, 48 hours, etc.) coding competition where software programmers, developers, designers, etc. come together to build and design something cool</h4>
  <h4  align=left style="color:HoneyDew"> Who can attend a hackathon? - Depends but for the most part ANYONE. Yep, you read it right. Anyone who is interested in computer programming and loves to learn and build cool stuff can attend. If a hackathon targets a specific audience (ex, college students), then obviously only college students are allowed to attend but there are hackathons for everyone</h4>

  <h4 align=left style="color:HoneyDew">  But isn’t hacking illegal? - Haha, my favorite part! The word “hack” has so much negativity attached to it that most people think hackathons are a way to “hack” into something. NOOOO. Hacking is basically building something. It could be anything </h4>
